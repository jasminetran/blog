<p> I love living in Colorado! Although most of my family does not live in Colorado, I grew up with all my sisters. I attended only Denver Public Schools and I still livedin the same neighborhood where I was raised. One thing that I adore most is the oportunities. Colorado is constantly growing and the need to serve others is also widening. I had a variety of unique experiences. I interned in the Colorado Children's Hosptial, which is one of the best in the nation. I was assigned in the Pulmonary Department and worked closely with professionals. Colorado is also great in technology development, so web courses are also beneficial. The image above is a photoshop image I created in a course last summer. </p>
