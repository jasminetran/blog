<p> This upcoming semester will be my second year in college. I am studying Integrative Physiology because I have always had a passion in health and sciences. I hope to pursue a career in the health profession. However, I am always open to learning about new ideas and finding more passions. Last semester, I was involved in a few groups. I joined Vietnamese Student Association to maintain my culture, started St. Jude at CU to fundraise, and participated in American Medical Women's Association.
