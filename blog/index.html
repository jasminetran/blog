  <p class="titles"> LAKE BUNYONYI </p>
  <p class="dates"> July 18 2017 </p>
  <hr width="300" align="center">

        <p> Lake Bunyonyi is located in Uganda between Kisoro and Babale while bordering Rwanda. It was one of the beautiful places I visited while traveling through East Africa! The lake surrounds many islands that inhabit many peoples and even animals. The islands also have churches, schools, and resorts that are open to visitors. While at the lake, I was able to visit schools, villages, and enjoy lake activities. Overall, my trip included teaching and visiting at various schools, interacting with business leaders, learning about the culture, and meeting beautiful individuals!

        <p> I was born and raised in Colorado! I have been involved with many different organizations throughout Colorado. I worked with non-profits, Children's Hospital, tutoring services, and web development courses! Because I never moved out of the state, I know alot about what Colorado has to offer.
