<p> I was honored to have the opportunity to travel to East Africa over the summer of 2015. Throughout the trip, I had many experiences that have shapes my passions and who I am today.

Before the trip, we collaborated with the team from Sprouts of Water. The organization is based in Uganda and creates ceramic water filters. Our role was to create a curriculum and teach it to students who would use the filters. The beginning of trip was focused on teaching primary and secondary students about water and everything around the subject. We made it very interactive and fun for the students! The next focus was learning from entrepreneurs and business throughout the town. We met with leaders of a bike company and school directors. Then, we had time to learn about the culture and people of the beautiful country. We visited different places and connected with many people.
